# Warps config
#
# name.cost = id
# name.class = id
# name.level = id
# name.reborn = id
# name.member = id
# name.location = m,x,y
#
# ExceptIDs are the item ids you aren't allowed to warp at.
# ExceptID = 1,5,11,29,35,52 (etc, separated by a comma)
#
# Example
#
# aeven.level = 3
# aeven.location = 5,40,43
#
# stronghold.level = 5
# stronghold.location = 20,17,30
#
# ExceptID = 1,2,3,4
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
