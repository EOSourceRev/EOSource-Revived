# The effect will play while opening a giftbox.
# The RewardID can contain an unlimited amount of items.
#
# Example:
#
# Amount = 1
#
# 1.GiftID = 4
# 1.RewardID1 = 5
# 1.RewardID2 = 10
# 1.RewardID3 = 12
# 1.Effect = 4
#
# 1.MinAmount = 1
# 1.MaxAmount = 3
#
# Note: Leave the Effect blank if you don't want to play an effect.
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
