## Party Maps
#
# KickTimer = id
#
# mapid.map = id
# mapid.partyreq = id
# mapid.kickmap = id
# mapid.kickx = id
# mapid.kicky = id
#
# Example:
#
# KickTimer = 20
#
# 26.map = 26
# 26.partyreq = 3
# 26.kickmap = 10
# 26.kickx = 25
# 26.kicky = 25
#
# These maps will automatically boot people out when they leave the party or map and
# Are also inaccessible unless you are in a party with the required members.
#
# It is recommended to create a new file and change the config to point at it
# rather than editing this file.
