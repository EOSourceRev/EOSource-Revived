Example command 1: Player Prefix

Main
{
	commandname = "reborn"
	type = "player"

	check Level(200);

	call GiveRebirth(1);
	call SetLevel(0);
	call SetExp(0);

	call quake(8, map);
	call KickPlayer();
}

Explanation:

When the player types #reborn the person will get 1 extra rebirth level.
Once the played obtained the rebirth level his level and exp will be set to 0.
The player however, has to be level 200 or he'll get a server message.

Victim can also be used, but in this case it's not necessary and can be left alone.

Example command 2: Admin Prefix

Main
{
	commandname = "reward"
	type = "admin"

	check Admin(3);

	call GiveItem(arguments[1], arguments[2], victim);
	call ServerMessage("You have been rewarded with an item!", victim);
}

Explanation:

Argument[1] is the item id given by entering the first argument: $reward hollow 1
Argument[2] is the amount id given by entering the second argument: $reward hollow 1 500

This command will give the victim 500 of item id 1 (gold).
Commands should be saved as 00001.ecf etc.
