Added command scripting action: givestats(stat, amount), e.g: action givestats("str", 20);

Modified that "check partner" no longer takes a partner name as argument but checks whether you are married or not.

Add "character" or "world" as last argument of the servermsg action to specify if a server message should be visible for everyone or just 1 player.
Add "character" or "pet" as last argument of openlocker to specifiy if a character's locker should be opened or from his pet, if available.
Add "true" or "false" as last argument of a command check to enable error messages, if not specified then error messages will be shown.

- location
- map
